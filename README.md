# Spotify Clone
In this project, I created a comprehensive music streaming application using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and PostgreSQL. This project was my first attempt at creating a full stack application without any partners or team members, so I was forced into an environment in which I had to learn everything from setup to deployment. This appliaction mirrors Spotify's key features, offering user experiences such as:
 - file and image upload
 - secure credential authentication
 - audio playback
 - a favorite songs system
 - as well as server error handling

This project showcases my dedication in learning unfamiliar technologies, as well as my ability to create a fully pollished full stack application.

## Deployment
This project is currently deployed using vercel at [this](https://spotify-clone-surya-sunkari.vercel.app/) domain.
